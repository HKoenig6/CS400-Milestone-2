# QuizGenerator
This project is composed of four of us working on a quiz generator in Java. This documentation is quite lacking, but the source is all available here.
I believe that we used JavaFX to display our content, and we also gained more experience with event-based and functional programming through the application of lambda expressions.
I may update this further since we made this a while ago; unfortunately, an executable seems to not be included in these files, and some APIs are likely outdated.
